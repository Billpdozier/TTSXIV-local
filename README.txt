INSTALLATION:
	*make sure you have Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/*
	*ive only configured this for windows*
	- make sure anaconda is install to the default path: https://www.anaconda.com/
	- run install.bat to create the anaconda environment (under the name TTSXIV)
	- use config.json to configure the port number used by TextToTalk and SAPI speech rate
	- finally, run start.bat to start the client and enjoy!

		- TTS audio is produced from the client console, not in-game

***THIS IS A FREE, AND GENERALLY FASTER ALTERNATIVE, BUT QUALITY IS NOTICABLY LACKING COMPARED TO THE MODEL USED BY https://coqui.ai/ ***
